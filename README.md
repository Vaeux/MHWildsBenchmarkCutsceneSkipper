# MH:Wilds Standalone Benchmark Cutscene Skipper

This simple REFramework mod skips the cutscenes in the standalone benchmark, and also adjusts the score at the end to compensate for the points you miss by skipping them.

## Installation
1. Install the latest [REFramework nightly release](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases)
   - The file you want is "MHWILDS.zip". Extract **ONLY** the dinput8.dll file into your MonsterHunterWildsBenchmark folder, next to MonsterHunterWilds.exe.
2. Extract [this mod's zip file](https://github.com/Vaeux/MHWildsBenchmarkCutsceneSkipper/releases/download/v1.0/BenchmarkCutsceneSkipper.zip) into the same folder

## Usage
- Once installed, it just works
- After launching the benchmark, press Insert to toggle the REFramework UI off or on
  - REFramework's "Configuration" pane has an option to remember whether it was closed
- To toggle the mod's functionality, expand REFramework's "Script Generated UI" pane and use the "Skip Cutscenes" checkbox
  - Toggling mid-benchmark may result in an inaccurate final score
